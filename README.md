# Localhost SEO

A small tool for debugging and visualizing meta tags for a website or webapp hosted on localhost (or online).

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Installation

After installing docker, run the following command to start using the app:

```
docker run -d -p 8053:8053 marcusfrdk/localhost-seo:0.0.3
```

This will download the Docker container and run it in the background on [localhost:8053](http://localhost:8053).

## Notes

- Only `static` html tags are supported. This means that tags that are generated by JavaScript will not be shown, such as `google.com` or `facebook.com`. These sites will not display as expected.

- Some sites like `twitter.com` block cross-origin requests, which means theses sites can not be fetched and shows an error.
